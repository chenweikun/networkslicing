   Optimal Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks with Flexible Routing and Guaranteed E2E Latency

by Wei-Kun Chen, Ya-Feng Liu, Antonio De Domenico, Zhi-Quan Luo, and Yu-Hong Dai.
(to appear in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 2021)

To run the code, we need to install: 
(i) GUROBI: https://www.gurobi.com
(ii) YALMIP: https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/installation


## Description of the files

test.m: a simple example
NS_I.m: the (NS-I) formulation
NS_II.m: the (NS-II) formulation
r_seed.mat: the random seed
random_generated_procedure.m: a procedure to generate the random instances
constructed_virtualgraph.m: a procedure to transform the physical graph/network to the virtual network 
                            (called by random_generated_procedure.m)
compare_two_formulations.m: a procedure to compare the performance the (NS-I) and (NS-II) formulations
									 (to run the code, we need to generate the random instances first)
paths_rates.m: a procedure to compute the number of paths and the data rates on each path
					(called by NS_II.m)
